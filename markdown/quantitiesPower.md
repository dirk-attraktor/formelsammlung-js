|-|-|-|-|-|-|

The picowatt is equal to one trillionth (10−12) of a watt. 
Technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers, acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy.

The nanowatt is equal to one billionth (10−9) of a watt. Important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers.

The microwatt is equal to one millionth (10−6) of a watt. Important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the EEG and the ECG, in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers. 
Compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts.[3]

| Milliwatt |  | mW | Microwatt | Watt |  |

The milliwatt is equal to one thousandth (10−3) of a watt. A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power, whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt.[4] Audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dBm, referenced to one milliwatt.

The kilowatt is equal to one thousand (103) watts. This unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors, tools, machines, and heaters. It is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters.
One kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34 horsepower. A small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt. The average electric power consumption of a household in the United States is about one kilowatt.[notes 2][5]
A surface area of one square meter on Earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the sun (the solar irradiance) (on a clear day at mid day, close to the equator).[6]

| Megawatt |  | MW | Kilowatt | Gigawatt |  | 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|

The megawatt is equal to one million (106) watts. Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale, 
including large electric motors; large warships such as aircraft carriers, cruisers, and submarines; large server farms or data centers. 
A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat. 
On railways, modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6 MW, although some produce much more. 
The Eurostar, for example, uses more than 12 MW, while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produce/use 3 to 5 MW. U.S. nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300 MW.[7]

The gigawatt is equal to one billion (10^9) watts or 1 gigawatt = 1000 megawatts. 
This unit is often used for large power plants or power grids. 
For example, by the end of 2010 power shortages in China's Shanxi province were expected to increase to 5–6 GW[8] 
and the installed capacity of wind power in Germany was 25.8 GW.[9] 
The largest unit (out of four) of the Belgian Doel Nuclear Power Station has a peak output of 1.04 GW.[10] HVDC converters have been built with power ratings of up to 2 GW.[11]

The terawatt is equal to one trillion (1012) watts. 
The total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts (see primary energy). 
The average lightning strike peaks at 1 terawatt, but these strikes only last for 30 microseconds.

Based on the average total solar irradiance[15] of 1.366 kW/m2, the total power of sunlight striking Earth's atmosphere is estimated at 174 PW (see: solar constant).
