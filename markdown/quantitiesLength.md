1 millionths of a Millimeter. The nanometer is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale: the diameter of a helium atom, for example is 0.1 nm.
The nanometer is also commonly used to specify the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the visible part of the spectrum: visible light ranges from around 400 to 700 nm

1/1000 of a Millimeter. The micrometer is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation as well as sizes of biological cells and bacteria.
Micrometers are the standard for grading wool by the diameter of the fibres; wool finer than 25 µm can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear, rugs, and carpets.[2] The width of a single human hair ranges from approximately 10 to 200 µm. The first and longest human chromosome is 10µm in length.

1/1000 of a meter. A millimeter is equal to exactly 5/127 (approximately 0.039370) of an inch.
The smallest distances the human eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm, approximately the width of a human hair.[6] A sheet of paper is typically between 0.07 mm and 0.18 mm thick, with ordinary printer paper or copy paper approximately a tenth of a millimeter thick
